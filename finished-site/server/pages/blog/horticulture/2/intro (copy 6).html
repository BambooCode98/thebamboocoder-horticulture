<p>Welcome to The Bamboo Coder. A blog about bamboo, plants, and more!</p>
<h3 id="who-am-i">Who Am I?</h3>
<p>I am an avid gardener that loves to grow plants for many different reasons. One of my favorite plants is bamboo, however, when it comes to choosing a favorite plant I honestly can say all plant species are my favorite.</p>
<p>I first came to gardening during the severe drought in 2012. When I started my first garden and saw plants grow from a seed to a full, healthy plant, I immediately knew gardening was something I wanted to do forever. After this, I went to college and earned both a forestry and a business management degree. I have taken many horticulture courses to further supplement my knowledge about plants. I also find growing plants is a great way to relax and enjoy the outdoors.</p>
<p>This blog is my first blog, and I aim to make this blog a place to find all the information you can imagine about bamboo, plants, and sustainable practices.</p>
<p><a href="http://192.168.0.118:3000/about">To read more about me and my goals for this blog, click here.</a></p>
<h3 id="what-is-this-blog-about">What is this blog about?</h3>
<p>The goal I have in mind with this blog is to spread information about bamboo, gather all the information I can about bamboo into one place, spread gardening knowledge, and have a place to disucss plants. I would like to create a detailed list of plant species and have it on this blog for a quick and easy reference for anyone to access.</p>
<p>Since I have started growing bamboo, I came to realize that information regarding many bamboo species is very limited. I have also noticed that it can be rather difficult to find information about bamboo because it is spread thin and across numerous websites. It is this spread of information that I intend to tackle with this blog by gathering all the knowledge that I can about bamboo and posting it here. However, I also aim to go over horticultural, forestry, gardening, and many other plant related topics. Sometimes the weather may be mentioned, especially if it has a substantial effect on plants.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-you-expect-to-learn-from-this-blog">What can you expect to learn from this blog?</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can expect to learn anything about bamboo from this blog!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will also be plenty of information on many other plants species for you to learn about. Propagation tips will be given on individual plant species so you can maximize your ability to grow new plants from seeds, cuttings, and some other propagation methods if it is warranted for that species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Horticultural and forestry related topics will be written about to give you more insight to create healthy, maintainable plants, forests, and gardens.</p>
