The first stage is the seedling stage, the second stage occurs when the plant begins to form into a vine, and the third stage occurs when the plant is mature. \n\nThe seedling of poison ivy varies the most in appearance from the mature plant, and has been the most difficult for me to identify. \n\nI have found it difficult to find good images of a poison ivy seedling on the internet over the years, so now that I have a multitude of them I plan to put them in this post to show you what it looks like. With my experience from the honeysuckles, I have found it best to identify the seedling and remove the problematic plant before it become a major pest in the landscape. So remember, always aim to look for the seedling before it becomes too big!\n\n| ![Poison-Ivy-Seedling](/images/article-images/poison-ivy/poison-ivy-featured.png \"Poison Ivy Seedling\") |\n|:--:|\n| *Poison ivy seedling that recently sprouted.* |\n\nAs pictured above, the seedling will have two oblong, oval-shaped leaves that indicate it recently sprouted. The first few pairs of true leaves that emerge will appear have the characteristic poison ivy \"leaves of three\", however, the leaves will **NOT** look the same as the mature plant. Any young or newly emerging spring growth from poison ivy will have a reddish-bronze coloring that will fade to green with time.\n\nUnfortunately, at the seedling stage poison ivy will pretty much look exactly the same as fragrant sumac, which is a plant you should want around!\n\n| ![Mature-Poison-Ivy](/images/article-images/poison-ivy/mature-poison-ivy-leaf.png \"Poison Ivy Leaf\") |\n|:--:|\n| *Poison ivy leaf with the main leaflet stem extended.* |\n\n\n\nThe mature poison ivy will have the \"leaves of three\" characteristic in a similar way to the seedling, however, the stem (petiole) on the middle leaf will be extended (circled above in black), while the other two will be directly attached to the leaf stem. During the mature phase, and over the summer, poison ivy will usually tend to develop red bumps on the leaves. These red bumps only appear on poison ivy, and can help you distinguish it from other plants that may look similar to it. I have never seen any other plant similar to poison ivy develop these red bumps.\n\nIn the fall, poison ivy leaves will take on a brilliant bright orange color. They are usually among one of the first plants to start having leaf changes, so the color will help to identify it in the fall. Look out if you see a large vine with orange leaves climbing up a tree, or running along the ground, that is poison ivy!\n\nThe winter stems of poison ivy tend to look reddish. This helps distinguish the plant from other plants during the winter. For instance, if you ever find yourself walking in a field and see a bunch of red, twigged stems growing close to the ground it is very likely to be poison ivy. Another winter characteristic of poison ivy are the berries. Poison Ivy has white berries that hang in clusters. So, be careful if you see a cluster of white berries in the winter.\n\n| ![Poison-Ivy-Stem](/images/article-images/poison-ivy/poison-ivy-stem.jpg \"Poison Ivy Stem\")|\n|:--:|\n| *Stem of Poison Ivy Growing on Tree. Note the roots growing onto the tree.* |\n\n\nThe main characteristic I have found to remain true with poison ivy is the tendency for the plant to take on some form of red/orange color. It must be one of nature's stop signs as this is clearly meant to be a warning to stay away! With time, you will begin to recognize poison ivy everywhere you go, and I mean *everywhere* you go. \n\n### Poison Ivy Look-Alikes\n\nThere are some plants that look like poison ivy (a few look nearly identical), however, there are key differences between poison ivy and these other plants.\n\n#### Box Elder - (Acer Negundo)\n\n| ![Box-Elder](/images/article-images/poison-ivy/box-elder-tree.png \"Young Box Elder\") | ![Box-Elder-Leaves](/images/article-images/poison-ivy/box-elder-leaves.png \"Close-up of Box Elder leaves with three leaflets\") |\n|:-:||:-:|\n| *Young Box Elder Tree With Leaves of Three* | *Close up of the leaves*\n\nBox Elder is easily distinguishable from poison ivy, especially as it gets older. Box Elder is a tree that typically ranges from 25-45 feet tall, each leaf has three to five leaflets, has smooth, green bark that turns gray and fissured with age, and has an opposite branch arrangement. Box Elder is in the maple family (Acer), and as such I have noticed it may sometimes give off a strong maple syrup scent during warm summer days.\n\n#### Fragrant Sumac - (Rhus aromatica)\n\n| ![Fragrant-Sumac](/images/article-images/poison-ivy/fragrant-sumac.png \"Fragrant Sumac\") |\n|:--:|\n| *Fragrant Sumac Starting to Grow for the Year* |\n\nFragrant Sumac is best described as a creeping shrub that may sometimes resemble a vine. Due to this it can look nearly identical to poison ivy. However, it lacks the extended stem (petiole) in the middle that can be seen in the poison ivy picture above. All of its leaflets are attached to the leaf at one fixed point. Another distinguishing feature between Fragrant Sumac and Poison Ivy are the berries. Poison Ivy has white berries, while Fragrant Sumac has fuzzy, red berries. Fragrant Sumac also has a unique lemony fragrance when crushed. Similar to other members of the Sumac family (Rhus), it can be used in cooking as a lemony seasoning.\n\n#### Virginia Creeper - (Parthenocissus quinquefolia)\n\n| ![Virginia-Creeper](/images/article-images/poison-ivy/viginia-creeper-leaf.jpg \"Virginia Creeper Leaf\") |\n|:--:|\n| *Virginia Creeper Leaf with Five Leaflets* |\n\nVirginia Creeper is a vine simillar to poison ivy, and when it is young it has a tendecy to develop a leaf with three leaflets. However, as the plant grows older it takes on its mature leaves which have leaves with **five** leaflets attached at one point. The berries of Virginia Creeper are a deep blue to purple color, unlike Poison Ivy's white berries. The fall color of Virginia Creeper is an astounding red color, whereas poison ivy is more of a bright orange color.\n\n### Methods To Treat Poison Ivy\n\nThe first thing to do if you believe you have come into contact with poison ivy is to **_immediately_** rinse the affected area with a strong dish soap and cold water. Poison Ivy causes its rash through a volatile oil called urushiol. The dish soap will help break down the oil and pull it away from the skin, while the cold water will help lessen absorption rates into the skin.\n\nThe next best method to treat a poison ivy rash if you are in the middle of the woods is to look for Jewelweed. Jewelweed and Poison Ivy share the same habitats, so they often grow close together. Jewelweed is believed to be the best antidote against Poison Ivy, however, its mechanism of action in stopping the rash is still relatively unknown.\n\n\n| ![Jewelweed's-Classic-Flower](/images/article-images/poison-ivy/jewelweed-flower.png \"Jewelweed's Classic Orange Flower\") | ![Jewelweed-Plant](/images/article-images/poison-ivy/jewelweed-plant.png \"Jewelweed\")\n|:-:||:-:|\n| *Look for this flower in Summer to find Jewelweed easily.* | *Jewelweed* |\n\nMy experiences with Jewelweed have not been related to poison ivy, but from treating bug bites. I have found Jewelweed to be an **amazing** anti-itch remedy for just about any ailment that can cause itching. All you need to do is take the leaves from a Jewelweed plant, crush them, and apply it to the affected area. For Poison Ivy rashes this would need to be done immediately to prevent the urushiol from taking affect. I really cannot recommend Jewelweed enough because of how useful it is!\n\nLastly, if the above options are unavailable you can buy a special type of Poison Ivy soap to have around that will lessen the affects from the rash.","post":"poisonIvy"},"__N_SSG":true}
